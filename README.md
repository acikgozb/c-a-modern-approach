# C Programming: A Modern Apporach

Contains examples and projects' solutions of the book *C Programming: A Modern Approach* by K. N. King.

You can check out the book from [here](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd/dp/0393979504).

## Disclaimer

This repository only contains solutions for the projects of chapters that are relevant with my interests.
That is why some chapters are not added in this project.

I intentionally skipped the exercise questions, I will add them later on when I re-read the book.

If you are currently reading this book and do not have a repository yet, I would highly recommend you to create one and write down your own solutions before checking out what others have done.
